# SteamP2PTransport‑MLAPI‑UNITY‑TEST

A test project using Steam P2P Transport with MLAPI (the older Unity Netcode library) in Unity.

---

## 📝 Description

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of Steam’s peer‑to‑peer transport layer (via the original MLAPI) for Unity multiplayer.  
Note: MLAPI has since been succeeded by Unity’s “Netcode for GameObjects” and the SteamP2P transport may require updates for newer versions of Unity.  

---

## 🛠 Features

- Utilizes Steam P2P transport as network layer for MLAPI.  
- Basic test setup for Unity multiplayer environment.  
- Source code in C# demonstrating transport integration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com//Aurasj/SteamP2PTransport-MLAPI-UNITY-TEST
   open with Unity
```
2.Open the project in Unity (version compatible with the MLAPI version used).

3.Ensure Steamworks or Steam P2P dependencies are properly set up.

4.Build and run the scene tested for multiplayer transport.

⚠️ Important Notes

Because MLAPI has been integrated into Unity’s official Netcode and the transport API may have changed, some parts may be outdated or require modification for use with newer Unity versions.
See community issue: “Compile errors with MLAPI  & SteamP2P transport” 
For recent projects consider migrating to Netcode for GameObjects with updated Steam/Relay transport.
